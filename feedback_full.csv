"i absolutely love this app, everything is just great. i am a student and i use this app to prepare contemporary affairs for my exams. it would be wonderful if somehow i could filter news based on location more precisely as even with location on a lot of the categories are world specific where it would be useful to have feature to filter out local news per category. thank you for the efforts, love the app!

"Hi there! 😊 I'm Gokula Kannan, and I just have to say that I absolutely adore this app! I've been a big fan of Flipboard for years, but after using this app for just a month, it feels like the perfect fit for me. Thank you so much! I've shared it with all my friends too. Keep up the amazing work! 🚀 I'd love to see even more improvements in line with iOS 26's new UI and features. I'll definitely let you know if any ideas pop into mind. Thanks again! "

i’ve only had the app shortly but i can already tell it’s an innovative and useful news app. 100% the best for me personally out of others. however a few things immediately stood out to me. i like the system to personalise what i follow however a way to directly follow a certain strain of stories would be nice. for example following everything to do with just liverpool. another feature that would be nice is a way to narrow down politics to my own country like england/uk. also this one isn’t a big deal but being able to change the language to British english would be a good quality of life update. also in the future you should 100% add a threads system under stories like twitter or instagram it would definitely boost time spent on your app and interest. keep up the good work and don’t ruin your app you have a big chance at success. 
This is an example of Particle pushing a narrative that is untrue based on sensationalist journalism with political bias and no sourcing. The articles you list as “sources” do not provide any third-party sources for the claims themselves.  It is unfortunate that Particle is pushing propaganda on my news feed. *Feedback provided on question*: Request: What bias is this reporting from? The only sources Particle lists are Fox News and Breitbart. Response: Right-leaning bias.

"상호작용 요소가 있는 Dear Developer of Particle, I am one of your big fan so i just wanted to take a moment to thank you for creating such an incredible AI app that has transformed the way I read and process articles and news.This AI has been an invaluable tool in my daily routine, making me more efficient and enhancing my understanding of various topics. I am now studying pharmacology at univ in Korea and nearly read nothing all day for, I’ve been quite busy with exams:( one day, I saw a reels introducing your app so I gave a try which turned out to be awesome!!  Best feature I particularly appreciate is the related articles and following bottons, which allows me to get to know more about the content Im interested in and get instant, accurate summaries. This has saved me a tremendous amount of time, especially when dealing with complex or lengthy articles. Your app has not only made staying informed easier but has also made the process more enjoyable. I’m truly grateful for the hard work and innovation that went into developing such an app! 👍 The user-friendly interface and the option to organize my library into collections make it feel like a personal assistant tailored just for me. I’ve recommended AI to several friends and they’ve all been impressed by its capabilities. The question popped up my head that how does this app earn fortunes for the developers? This service is completely free and I don’t particularly see ads (for my type at least) i sincerely hope this app one day costs a heavy fee as gpt or perplexity ;( and I also want to know is there any stock related with your app that I could own cause I strongly believe this service will one day skyrocket and that would come very soon. Thank you again for your dedication to creating such a helpful tool. It’s clear that a lot of thought and effort went into making it as effective and user-friendly as possible. Best regards,-yong-"

"This is a game changing application. Unfortunately, it didn’t appear to reliably pull from smaller sources. As a person into mostly fringe media like gaming, mma, technology, and indie films—it seems line I only have a handful of “stories” to read on particle. Whereas my RSS setup has hundreds of articles a day—most of which Particle has no idea about.   Seems like it’s more for actual big media journalism and such, which is cool, but that really excludes a massive chunk of the internet. I want the news that matters to me, not what you think matters to me. Could Particle potentially add some rss ingestion which then applies its magic to the hundreds of stories and turn them into dozens?   Love the app. I’m just regularly running out of stuff for it to suggest to me and having to track it down manually through the explore and search sections. There’s more in there that I want—it just isn’t being offered to me. This is after extensive training of topics I am interested in.   Thanks!"

"Dear Particle News Team,  I just wanted to say how much I love using Particle News! It’s such an innovative and exciting app — I truly enjoy the experience.  However, I was a bit disappointed to see that it’s currently available only in English. I couldn’t figure out how to change the language settings, and I would love to use the app in German and Turkish as well.  Would you please consider adding German and Turkish language support in the near future? That would make the app even more amazing and accessible for users like me.  Thank you so much for your great work!  Best regards, Toprak "

"Hi there, i really enjoy the app from a usability and features perspective. However In Germany it appears that in Germany only a few news outlets are used as sources. For example i really see Tagesschau ZDF or like that."
"At present, adjusting the frequency is not particularly intuitive. The issue arises when searching for specific subcategories, as they appear multiple times within the list. It becomes unclear for which instance the priority should be increased. (For example, I wish to see more content related to German ice hockey but „Eishockey“ appeared in like 10 categories and i don’t know the difference.)"
"It would be great to have all the options for the news summary in the target language, like German. For example, I want the summary, ELI5 format, controversial views translated automatically as well."

"Hello team Particle, I am Soham, one of your user. I used your app and tbh it’s amazing! The user interface, the main points it extract from reliable sources and the statistics it shows about the sources! Truly amazing and good stuff. I just want to mention two significant issue i faced while using your app. 1st issue i faced was heating issue on my iPhone 15 (256GB, iOS 18.4) I felt a significant warmth while holding the phone and i used the app for mere reading and normally navigating news (approx 15mins). Secondly, i encountered a stutter. After using the app for 15-18 mins, while reading an article it got freeze in between nothing was working for like 10 secs i tried closing the app and restarting it again but nothing worked i waited a bit longer then it started functioning normally. I encountered these issues 3-4 times so i thought to let the team know about it. Im looking forward for an update if necessary to resolve these issues. Please look into this.  Thanks & Regards."

"This answer fails to include critical contextual information about the circumstances surrounding Abrego Garcia’s arrival in the US, as well as the role of US immigration policy in preventing others like him from obtaining legal recognition as asylum seekers, residents, citizens, etc.  Abrego was sent here by his family when he was just 16 years old. By definition, he couldn’t have made the choice to cross the US-Mx border illegally. He was too young at the time - at least according to US law - to live on his own without a parent or guardian, let alone undertake a project like traveling from El Salvador through Mexico, into Texas, and then onto Maryland independently. Of note, his status as a minor child barred him from making other independent decisions - including, say, obtaining legal representation to pursue an asylum case - after he arrived. While some might want to argue that he should have hired an attorney the moment he turned 18, I respectfully ask that they take an afternoon to research the options he had available to him at that time and then ask themselves what they would have done differently- or expected their 18-year-old son to do - under similar circumstances. Without these additions, this answer is harmful.  *Feedback provided on question*: Request: Did Garcia come to the us leagally? Response: No, Garcia entered the U.S. illegally.

I especially appreciate the different reading options like the “5 Ws” and “Explain Like I’m 5” — they make consuming news more approachable and engaging.  However, the user interface could use some improvement. It can feel a bit overwhelming at times, as the app tends to bombard you with a lot of information all at once. A cleaner, more organized, or minimalistic design would definitely take the experience to a 5/5 for me.  Overall, I genuinely enjoy the app and can see myself using it more in the future!"

Most times, a news story is just the latest in a whole series of related events, but this app only pulls from that newest event and doesn’t make it easy at all to see context of what led up to this event.

"Hi there I love your app!! I’ve been searching for a news app for a really long time now and yours is almost perfect. I really like the AI summaries and they way you designed the app. There is just one thing I’d like to share though I’m afraid it’s a little to big to incorporate this easily. So reading the news I’d like to be informed about all major sectors of society, even things I’m not interested in (like celebrities or sports in my case), just to be informed and know what is on people’s mind. Using your app I don’t have the feeling that I’m informed on a broad spectrum of society as the subjects seem rather random. I think introducing categories would help a lot!! You could show 3-4 major stories while also offering the possibility to dive deeper into one specific category (like sports) or shifting the focus of a category (US sport, European sports, world wide sports, cycling, cricket, specific teams …). This addition would make the app perfect for me!! Thanks for taking the time to go through my long feedback! 🙈 again really excited for this app. All the best, Sven "

"When using iPad to explore the news in the search section while choosing a “mixed” story display style, the dense news and large scaled ones are showing in the same line causing a sense of imbalance.

But I am a user from the other side of the sea - China, which means that when I opened the app in 22:00 this Sunday (just now), I only found 5 or 6 stories available and cannot review the news i had viewed earlier this day. I will love it if there will be a “recently viewed” section, maybe in the settings page or so. And adjusting the news auto deleting function might also help?

"Loving the improvements to the modules!   I can understand using only the truncated summary response on the Q&A to keep them brief and compact so the card heights don’t wildly differ, but I do find the full response to be way more interesting and nuanced than the summaries provide and there’s not much indication you can view that. The full response is hidden behind a 2-tap even if you select one directly from the parent carousel.  Maybe a good compromise would be to expand them to show the full response in the bottom sheet / collection view with an option to minimize them reddit-style, instead of paging for it.

"Hi! I noticed a small rendering artifact when tapping on a story in the main feed. The story scales down on touch-down, and during the scale animation there’s a hairline seam that becomes visible. This is likely a SwiftUI issue where both the top and bottom views are being scaled independently during the scale effect, and because their heights are rounded, it’s falling on different pixels and causing a seam.

There are unlabeled buttons throughout the app. There are mislabeled buttons, such as: the back arrow in the top left-hand corner when reading an article. The three tabs down at the bottom of the screen could use labels for VoiceOver users. Currently the label just reads as the icon.

"First, well done. This is my new go-to news app. Couple of suggs.   1. I want to follow one specific college sports team and exactly zero other sports news. I suspect I’m not the only no-sports-except-alma mater person out there. This seems like a nearly impossible task within the app.   2. Would love to more easily +/- the “topics” blocks.   3. The ability to have the latest stories read out loud like a playlist is awesome. Would love to wake up to that like I used to do with the NYT’s “Up First” podcast. But I don’t want to hear all the stressful news right out of bed. I need positive news that has just enough depth to get my brain moving and thinking without reminding me of the awful state of the world.

"Hi, overall I’m loving this app.   The overall functionality with the addition of diverse POV’s similar to Ground News approach but better articulated is very nice. Your integration of ‘gold star??’ Content is nicely done. Also your approach on AI integration in a more subdued way is appreciated - it’s not over-handed.   If I could make any suggestion it would be the following (note this is more of a personal aesthetic issue)  Taking a page from on Flipboard, I love clean lines. Personally, I’m not a fan of the rounded corner treatment - I get it as it’s indicative of cards - just a personal preference for me.   The more egregious issue for me is the use of drop shadows everywhere - they really should be outlawed somewhere. It takes what could be a cleaner user flow & well…..you get the idea.

I marked the Sports category and all of its subtopics as “don’t want”, but there are other topics which contain sports-related posts, so those still make it to my feed. 😐   Another example: “gaming” can be found in multiple categories. It seems like users might have to configure the frequency for each different category “Gaming”, “Video Games”, various gaming subtopics under “Entertainment”. It’s unclear how the settings for each category might affect the other related categories.

"*Feedback*: > So far, really enjoying the app, so THANK YOU.   Like the big format list. I do prefer smaller listings in general but I find the format here too condensed. Bold article titles as a block is hard to read—suggest lowering the font weight. 2 lines of summary with truncation might also be worth looking at. Yes it will increase the height of each row but it will bring greater context. The mixed format, some large, some small, is too hard to scan as I need to adjust how I read each row too much.   Article details are awesome. Love the bullets, images, quotes and grouped articles. I actually used that article grouping to find sites you’re using and then subscribed to those that met my reading interests, eg Decrypt magazine. Somehow surfacing the sites with follow options in a better way might be a useful feature as well as a good signal on what people are looking at.

"*Feedback*: > Creative/graphic designer here.  I love the advanced topic preferences, but we need a lot more variety—such as art, design, men’s fashion/style, graphic design, and aesthetics. Currently, the topics lean too heavily towards male techies. Although I follow tech, AI, software, and hardware trends, I’ll quickly lose interest if my homepage is dominated by tech news every day, with my other interests pushed to the bottom. There may be a need for an option to limit the number of stories from a single broad topic until a greater variety of topics has been shown.  I got tired of Artifact for this very reason. Algorithms are definitely the way forward, but there needs to be a balance—like chocolate: people love it, but they’d soon get tired of it if it were the only thing they were given to eat each day.

"A half baked idea:  I sometimes get nostalgic for how scannable news used to be on Twitter and think wouldn't it be cool if I could have my Particle notifications in a timeline/feed I could scroll through with links to the stories.  But then... what if there were personas for broader topics and entities that the notifications fell under (eg. @popcrave for the Celebrities topic, or @macrumors for Apple news). The headline could be through a ""persona"" completion, like what we for the Gen-Z and Energetic Rambling translations.  But then... for trending stories, what if there were a few rando personas that replied in-thread with ""personalized translations"" of the points from opposite sides, or the five W's. Or that posted quotes and pictures from the story. Or asked one of the suggested questions, which was answered by the OP.  It would be bizarre, since it's all synthesized... But we're used to tweets that are messy, and ephemeral, and bot-influenced so it might feel familiar. It'd be interesting to see how features appear through the lens of a social timeline, for example material updates as quote tweets.  Anyway, tl;dr I've got some experiments to play around with in Quantum. :slightly_smiling_face:"

I think it would be great to somehow get the LLM to attempt to be more succinct with quote context and names. Obviously it works well a lot of the time. But this screenshot is intense.

Similar issues with QA and a few other surfaces. Maybe there is a consistent requirement we can discover.

Just listened to my whole feed while driving to Tahoe. After listening to over 100 stories over more than an hour the overall experience was excellent especially for a v1. The transcripts are a really good first rev which is no small feat as some who has iterated for hours prototyping similar prompts. The technical execution was also really solid even knowing there are still a bunch of details that haven’t yet been worked on. It’s all made the more impressive given how many more opportunities there are to refine it. :clap::skin-tone-2: :clap::skin-tone-2: :clap::skin-tone-2:

&gt; Both actually! But I was specifically referring to the new carousel. I'm grateful for both!
(Asking)
"I don't think he's considering Citations as the same thing as the list of articles even though he's using ""cited"""
what about the word Citations as effectively the 6th bullet on every single story. insane.
"Yeah, there is certainly less reason for it at the top because, at least currenlty, you only have to scroll past the bullets to get to the articles carousel. But I think before the carousel part of what made this particular button less obvious is being at the top which has it kind of just above your direct attention and so kind of only peripheral vision sees it."
"also of course we did have the word Citations at the bottom of each bullets set, lol"
Well… maybe we should be taking this as a sign that just because a button is always on screen it doesn’t mean people see it or use it. And it may be contributing a LOT to the sense of clutter and busyness

Just wanted to share a great experience for me.   Hopped in the car to go grab some dinner. Threw up my feed. First story was about Diablo IV because I follow the KGE and there was some new stuff released today. Listened to a podcast outlining a specific bug and how it was disabled and what blizzard was saying about a fix. Hyper relevant to me playing later tonight probably. Then was able to quickly share the story to a friend(while driving lol).   The fact that my feed was so personalized. Kge follows. Audio generation. Hyper niche news elevated to an experience previously reserved for only the most general news. Felt very futuristic.   It’s nice to have moments like this where thousands of pieces of work over the last year come together to deliver an experience I value and couldn’t have with anything other than particle.

"*Feedback*: > Hi, just want to share some feedback after using Particle for a bit.   I really love almost everything about this app. The algorithm is great. I like that multiple sources are grouped into major headlines.  But, I really miss reading the actual news stories. I don’t want to only read AI summaries.   I think that something like a showing a button to go right into the most relevant outlets story on a topic on the main feed page would make this app a lot better for me.   For example, on all tech stories I would like to read them on the Verge. I like to read news stories on the Guardian. I can’t do that with particle, and that kind of makes the idea of having all news in one place useless.   Just reading AI summaries is really soulless.

"In terms of addressing this in app. I agree with Marcel. I think the order we try things if we keep hearing complaints is: • let the natural breakpoints land in tf • If that’s not enough. Add a button to the dragon breakpoint they have to hit to show the rest of the feed. (Client only) • Then if even that’s for some reason is not enough, we can look into filtering on the api(maybe an option deep in settings, I have mocks) But that’s just my opinion, and I really doubt we will need to do all of this. And of course we can easily adjust copy in plenty of places to see if it helps."

"I personally had a kind of neat affirming experience this morning.  This morning i went straight to reddit, not totally uncommon. But in my “still laying in bed passive scrolling” i definitely ran across a few news stories that i was definitely interested in, but absolutely didn’t tap into. I’m guessing because the difficulty of extracting information i would find valuable after going into these links, via comments or the root link itself, was predicted to be not worth the effort. But whatever, kept scrolling, memes, whatever.  Then a little later opening Particle and scrolling through and easily running into a few of the same stories, i was able to link them together very easily, i knew they were about the same thing. But immediately tapped in, nbd, because i knew that next level of cursory info that i really wanted was so easy and right there. Didn’t realize i’d done it until it had already happened.  Felt very visceral on Particle delivering something i wanted in reddit and couldn’t get. And also noting that the pairing of those activities together was decent as well. The fact that i browsed reddit first actually enhanced my particle experience.  Just thought i’d note it down."

"Fun anecdote from <@U07336L1761>:  He's been friends for a long time with the director of The Acolyte. He follows The Acolyte KGE with push notifications. Receiving one of these pushes will often spur an exchange with the director, and he's starting to feel like the front line on their PR team because he's often aware of coverage before anyone on her team is :sparkles:  As an aside, he also follows Elden Ring with notifications. The other day, there was a cluster about both the director and the game, so he got a push referencing that both of them were in the news about the same story. It was a delightful surprise you couldn't really get anywhere else at the moment."

that feature has been more or less an easter egg and it's kind of been just neglected/forgotten for a long time but it's pretty fun and should maybe be a little less hidden. granted we don't need every variation and it's kind of not great performance since it's just doing it all on demand but it's pretty fun.

Something that would help would be a UI where the categories were ranked by “salience” or how much of the category is represented by the article.

I’m sure this is more complicated in practice, but it first came up for me with an article about Trump (I turned that topic all the way down and it’s been great) and now I find myself wanting to tune things up or down based on some aspect of each article, it just takes too long. *From*: johnstokvis *Build*: 1.0(91)"

First time seeing a duplicate today
With this pretty important story. It was strange to see citations exclusively from what i consider a lower tier publisher when there are many higher tier publishers.   I didn’t confirm that only Denver Gazette had this info.  But I assume it’s not the only one with the info.   I realize it SHOULDNT matter. But as a dumb user it made me trust our bullets less and made me want to go to an article from a higher tier publisher like AP. And I suspect other dumb users may have a similar reaction.

"met with <https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxmullen/|Max Mullen> this morning who has become a ~DAU in the last little bit. he loves the app.  some feedback he had: • He noted that the feed was feeling increasingly better. I showed him some of the content preferences and (he didn't know about it before) and KGE adding / notifications. We already know this but having some tips will really help with education here. • He asked why we've never asked him about his preferences - I told him a new NUX was coming :slightly_smiling_face:  • He had a couple of feature requests:     ◦ He wants some opt-in way to know what his friends are reading. I asked if he saw that as a follow model, double-opt-in follow, etc. He said he knows that the mechanics around that could be challenging to get right, so ignoring that (lol), he just wants a very low friction way to know what his friends are reading, and be able to blast out that he read something he thinks his friends should read. He said this is his number 1 request.     ◦ Some granular controls (which, unlike the first bullet point, nobody has ever done btw). He showed an example of a story about Prince Harry's association with Nigeria (idk I didn't look deep into it). He was like, look....I don't give a shit about Prince Harry. BUT! If Prince Harry was IN SANFRANCISCO, yeah I would care, a lot. So as a result, I don't want to say ""less like this"" on the Prince Harry story because I don't know the effect it would have.         ▪︎ I tried to show an example of a video game story about God of War, and do a demo where I could go into topic preferences and say, ""More Video Games"" but ""Less God of War"" to explain how we have some building blocks around this granularity. Unfortunately, I spent a minute expanding and collapsing the topics (from the 3 dots) and could not find God of War in it at all. So all to say, in practice, the ease of being able to fulfill on the promise of ""yes video games but no God of War"" feels close but still a little out of reach. • We talked about business model / publisher payouts / etc and he was very excited about all the thinking we're doing in that arena."

"*Feedback*: > What a beautiful v1.0!  First impressions: - theres a lot to see but I was able to orient pretty quickly (I’m assuming you’ll have an onboarding flow eventually, but even without it, I picked up how the app works) - discovered the political spectrum feature after a few minutes and wanted more. Took a second to figure out it was present when I tapped into an article but that was a moment that hooked me (I said out loud “oh yes, going to be checking this app a lot”) - as I think about how I might work this app into my current flow, one thought occurred to me. I get shared articles a lot. It’s my dad’s “love language.” It would be really nice to pull it into particle and contrxtualize what he’s sending me into the larger story. See what it falls on the political spectrum, go deeper, that sort of thing - loved the zodiac sign in the profile. No idea what you plan to use it for, but it’s unique.

from Sam Pullara
"User: kpk Feedback: Loved the signup process. I was unsure why I needed a photo and username since there doesn’t seem to be a social element yet.   The main feed is vibrant and interesting. It drops frames when scrolling though, which is super distracting. (iPhone 12 (sorry), latest iOS). I’m not sure the scroll bar needs to be so visible.   When I say “see less” I’d like to be more specific. Eg, I don’t care about nba and there’s a lot of nba. I don’t much care about Swift or NFL either, but the combination in the news meant I watched the Super Bowl, so some things should be able to evade my “see less”.   Currently still using BBC as my primary news source. You have lots of world news, will be interesting to see if you can beat it, esp when it comes to integrity and authority."

"from Kayvon:  ```New build is much smoother. Noticed that scrolling the story detail view still feels a bit choppy, as does swiping BACK to go to the list view. But the list of stories view is much smoother.  Also, I often accidentally tap one of the keywords (e.g. Timothy Chalamet's name amidst the story title) and I'm always a bit surprised that it brings up the little keyword synopsis thing rather than just going straight to the story. 99% of the time I tap anything on the cell, I want to just see the story.

(sara's note: this is my transcription from a quick phone call)
"quick summary of some user feedback from alberto (former Twitter pm, good friend)  *Overall* • love the app, use it all the time, audio is my favorite feature, i listen in the evenings with my girlfriend Stories & For You: • Topic groupings are confusing, I still see many of the same topics not grouped. Like I'll see 4 trump stories in a row and then something that says "" 10 more trump stories"" • Entities (he's referring to KGEs) are meh. The things I want to know about aren't always an entity and the ones I see are usually obvious. They're cool I guess. I never really care about the related stories in there. • I like the political spectrum thing. But most of the time the story is balanced so it's not interesting. (Sara's note:....working as intended? lol) • Sports. I never care about sports beyond the final score. I'll only click in if something absolutely crazy has happened. But normally I just want the score and maybe the title and to move on. • LOVE LOCATION BASED. I want to filter by location. When it's nearby I always want to tap on it. • The modules are cool, but sometimes they are out of scope of the story and don't make sense. Search / Trending • Search is good. I use it and it works for me when I want to know about something I heard elsewhere and just get the summary. Audio: • Favorite part of the app (Sara's note: he's referring to generated podcast) • I love listening to it at 6pm and getting the like, ""wtf happened today"". • The intro and outro is too long, too repetitive and cheesy. ""Today we learned about blah blah"". And it's hard to skip. If it was short I wouldn't care but it's too long. • I want push notifications to tell me when my evening podcast is ready.  • I want to be able to deep dive on a story when I hear about it, instead of having to scroll or search for it. Commenting: • I don't care about comments but my girlfriend does. I don't even read them. But my girlfriend wants to read comments so I can ask her more about that. Overall I really like the app. I'll keep taking notes and send you more feedback"

"Here’s a summary of the key points: 1. Overwhelm and Volume: Many feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of news available, finding it hard to sift through vast amounts of content and decide what to read. 2. Bias and Objectivity: Concerns about bias in news reporting are prevalent. People are seeking unbiased, fact-based reporting but often find it difficult to identify or access. 3. Clickbait and Sensationalism: Clickbait headlines and sensationalist content are frustrating for those seeking straightforward news. This often leads to disappointment when the content doesn’t match the headline or lacks depth. 4. Fragmentation and Disaggregation: The distribution of news across various platforms and sources makes it challenging to find consolidated, relevant news. This is compounded by different platforms catering to specific interests (like tech, politics, food). 5. Paywalls and Access: Paywalls are a significant barrier, preventing access to full articles and quality content. Readers are looking for a balance between supporting journalism and having free access to information. 6. Personalization and Relevance: There is a desire for news that is personalized and relevant to individual interests and needs, but current systems often fail to deliver this effectively. 7. Quality and Depth of Reporting: Concerns about the declining quality of journalism, with an emphasis on quantity over in-depth, investigative reporting. 8. Social Media and Algorithm Challenges: The changing nature of platforms like Twitter and the dissatisfaction with algorithm-driven content feeds lead to challenges in finding timely and relevant news. 9. Local News Accessibility: Difficulty in accessing local news that’s relevant and detailed, especially in a format that’s easy to navigate and free from overwhelming information. 10. Time and Efficiency: People are looking for ways to consume news more efficiently, preferring summaries and digests that save time while still providing comprehensive coverage. 11. Misinformation and Trust: Discerning trustworthy sources and accurate information is a growing concern, especially with the proliferation of misinformation. 12. Navigational and UX Issues: Poor user experience on news websites and apps, including intrusive ads and bad interface design, hinders the news-reading experience. 13. Desire for Diverse Perspectives: There’s an interest in receiving news from multiple viewpoints to gain a more rounded understanding of events, but this is often hard to achieve with current news sources. Overall, people are seeking a news experience that is efficient, unbiased, comprehensive, and tailored to their interests, without being bogged down by sensationalism, paywalls, and poor user experiences.

Not that we have to, there is still a big market. Just an interesting thought."

"Re: “Good Hierarchy” comment from my grandfather  He has given this feedback a few times, and i wanted to ask what it actually meant.  When he has been saying this is he saying that his current For You feed is in a good order than he agrees with. “Important articles arranged in relative order of importance” is what he told me. But he does mean STORIES, not articles within a story.  Obviously we aren’t being super clever here, just riding on recency and article velocity. But i thought i’d mention what he means by this.  This also is reflective of something i’ve heard from a few people that think the main feed should be ordered more on importance(like news apps) than on recency(social paradigm). Obviously we need both. And i think we are heading in the right direction. But i thought this was useful context."

"At time of sharing, cluster headline has Biden KGE, and image features Trump. This doesn't bother me personally, but seems like a natural example to consider headline KGE+image matching. Makes me wonder if somewhere down the road cluster headline KGEs could be matched to object detection results from cluster images, so that featured cluster images had a higher probability of matching headline KGEs. Seems like a kind of fine-tuning... and I actually don't have strong conviction that it would make a huge difference. But sharing the thought. <https://particle-ten.vercel.app/cluster/987135>"

In this case the bias module. But in other cases the Q&amp;A output. Or a comment. micro-shareable  Seems like there would be some significant complexity to shareable deep-linking so much dynamic content… but the flip side is it would increase the surface-area of URL shareable content out of particle/hypothetical virality.

"User: nick Story: Trump Disqualified from Colorado's 2024 Primary Ballot; Appeal to U.S. Supreme Court Announced Link: <https://particlenews.ai/alpha/cluster?url_cluster_id=940825> Feedback: Great Particle moment. Newsweek is a publication I would never seek out. In context of the cluster, one of their articles stood out, and was a good read.   They had a video+caption version of the article content playing over the text, and the video content looked like it was output from a generative image model. Which led me to their AI policy which I thought was interesting and worth sharing. Seems quite AI forward to me. I liked their accountability statement. And specifically no AI images or video that appear “lifelike” which struck me as an interesting distinction!  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  As Newsweek evaluates AI-based tools that might help reporters, video editors, copy editors, assignment editors and others do their jobs more effectively, we will roll them out to the newsroom. Sometimes these tools will be deployed to small teams as experiments. These experiments will always be bound by the rules in this policy.  Newsweek believes that AI tools can help journalists work faster, smarter and more creatively. Sometimes, a tool will take away the more burdensome tasks of day-to-day journalism. In other cases, AI may put a project that was too time-consuming or expensive to pursue within our newsroom's grasp. We firmly believe that soon all journalists will be working with AI in some form and we want our newsroom to embrace these technologies as quickly as is possible in an ethical way.  AI is not accountable to Newsweek readers: we are. The burden of ensuring that all stories or other content meets Newsweek standards rests with our writers, editors and producers, always.  To that end, we will always comply with the following rules when working with AI:  IMAGES  Newsweek will avoid publishing AI generated images - either video or still pictures - that appear lifelike.  WRITTEN CONTENT - CORE FUNCTIONS  If a piece of written content involves the use of AI tools in writing, research, editing or other core journalism functions, three or more journalists should be involved in producing the story—an assigning editor, a reporter and a publishing editor.  WRITTEN CONTENT - SUPPORTING FUNCTIONS  The rules requiring the involvement of three journalists does not apply when AI tools are simply used to support a journalist's work such as for note taking, transcription and video script writing, writing social copy, A/B testing headlines, adding metadata or selecting images. However, the journalist using such tools will be responsible for ensuring they do not give rise to errors.  DISCLOSURE  Any journalist using any AI tool on a core journalism function must disclose that to their editor and the publishing desk. Any tool not previously used by Newsweek must be approved by the Standards Editor"

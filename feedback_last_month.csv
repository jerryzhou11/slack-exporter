"Earlier this week, I was talking with <@U07AJEPM7EX> and <@U092QRNF57S> about more user education in-app. All of us interns had a shared experience of showing the app to our parents and having them go through the personalization onboarding, but they still got confused/stuck with many of the features.  It's also something that's been coming up in the survey responses a lot - it seems like a lot of users aren't aware of all the features that we have to offer. More feature cards, or an onboarding tutorial, or feature videos on our website, might help with this user education issue.  I'll share more thoughts about this next Monday when I finish my findings report for the Focused Feeds survey."

"Feedback for Particle App:  I really enjoy using Particle! One of my favorite things about the app is how it presents article information in an easy-to-read format. I especially appreciate the different reading options like the ‚Äú5 Ws‚Äù and ‚ÄúExplain Like I‚Äôm 5‚Äù ‚Äî they make consuming news more approachable and engaging.  However, the user interface could use some improvement. It can feel a bit overwhelming at times, as the app tends to bombard you with a lot of information all at once. A cleaner, more organized, or minimalistic design would definitely take the experience to a 5/5 for me.  Overall, I genuinely enjoy the app and can see myself using it more in the future!"

"This answer fails to include critical contextual information about the circumstances surrounding Abrego Garcia‚Äôs arrival in the US, as well as the role of US immigration policy in preventing others like him from obtaining legal recognition as asylum seekers, residents, citizens, etc.  Abrego was sent here by his family when he was just 16 years old. By definition, he couldn‚Äôt have made the choice to cross the US-Mx border illegally. He was too young at the time - at least according to US law - to live on his own without a parent or guardian, let alone undertake a project like traveling from El Salvador through Mexico, into Texas, and then onto Maryland independently. Of note, his status as a minor child barred him from making other independent decisions - including, say, obtaining legal representation to pursue an asylum case - after he arrived. While some might want to argue that he should have hired an attorney the moment he turned 18, I respectfully ask that they take an afternoon to research the options he had available to him at that time and then ask themselves what they would have done differently- or expected their 18-year-old son to do - under similar circumstances.

The user interface, the main points it extract from reliable sources and the statistics it shows about the sources! Truly amazing and good stuff. I just want to mention two significant issue i faced while using your app. 1st issue i faced was heating issue on my iPhone 15 (256GB, iOS 18.4) I felt a significant warmth while holding the phone and i used the app for mere reading and normally navigating news (approx 15mins). Secondly, i encountered a stutter. After using the app for 15-18 mins, while reading an article it got freeze in between nothing was working for like 10 secs i tried closing the app and restarting it again but nothing worked i waited a bit longer then it started functioning normally. I encountered these issues 3-4 times so i thought to let the team know about it. Im looking forward for an update if necessary to resolve these issues. Please look into this.  Thanks & Regards."

I currently use ChatGPT and Gemini for this (works better on paid versions) and try diff prompts to either give a true summary or something way more detailed and informative (my preference)"

"Hi there, i really enjoy the app from a usability and features perspective. However In Germany it appears that in Germany only a few news outlets are used as sources. For example i really see Tagesschau ZDF or like that."
"At present, adjusting the frequency is not particularly intuitive. The issue arises when searching for specific subcategories, as they appear multiple times within the list. It becomes unclear for which instance the priority should be increased. (For example, I wish to see more content related to German ice hockey but ‚ÄûEishockey‚Äú appeared in like 10 categories and i don‚Äôt know the difference.)"
"It would be great to have all the options for the news summary in the target language, like German. For example, I want the summary, ELI5 format, controversial views translated automatically as well."
"In particular for Germany, there are numerous media sources (such as Tagesschau, ZDF, LTO, etc.) that are not yet included. It would maybe even be beneficial to include an option to add your own news sources."
Would be nice to have a somewhat timeline-like view or something at all that makes it possible to see whether you have already read a news article or not.

I assume the stories will change as I continue to tune, but I would love an option to pin certain topics or at least have a way to personalize your home feed so I can get to the type of content I want faster rather than rely solely on what the algorithm will show me. I tend to browse my current news app, Flipboard, based on topics and at the moment topics are buried in Explore or you have to search for them manually. It would be great if this could be an option.

"The answer is very west inclined which shows the west‚Äôs vested interested in igniting and keeping separatist movement in India via a drug-violence-political nexus *Feedback provided on question*: Request: What challenges remain in addressing Sikh separatist influence in Canada? Response: The challenges in addressing Sikh separatist influence in Canada include balancing free speech with preventing advocacy of violence, addressing the symbolic and political power of pro-Khalistan groups within the Sikh diaspora, and overcoming the legacy of past tensions between India and Canada. Additionally, both nations need to build trust and engage in consistent action on counter-extremism while navigating the broader geopolitical and domestic political dynamics that influence this issue.

"This is a game changing application. Unfortunately, it didn‚Äôt appear to reliably pull from smaller sources. As a person into mostly fringe media like gaming, mma, technology, and indie films‚Äîit seems line I only have a handful of ‚Äústories‚Äù to read on particle. Whereas my RSS setup has hundreds of articles a day‚Äîmost of which Particle has no idea about.   Seems like it‚Äôs more for actual big media journalism and such, which is cool, but that really excludes a massive chunk of the internet. I want the news that matters to me, not what you think matters to me. Could Particle potentially add some rss ingestion which then applies its magic to the hundreds of stories and turn them into dozens?   Love the app. I‚Äôm just regularly running out of stuff for it to suggest to me and having to track it down manually through the explore and search sections. There‚Äôs more in there that I want‚Äîit just isn‚Äôt being offered to me. This is after extensive training of topics I am interested in.   Thanks!"

This is an example of Particle pushing a narrative that is untrue based on sensationalist journalism with political bias and no sourcing. The articles you list as ‚Äúsources‚Äù do not provide any third-party sources for the claims themselves.  It is unfortunate that Particle is pushing propaganda on my news feed. *Feedback provided on question*: Request: What bias is this reporting from? The only sources Particle lists are Fox News and Breitbart. Response: Right-leaning bias.

"ÏÉÅÌò∏ÏûëÏö© ÏöîÏÜåÍ∞Ä ÏûàÎäî Dear Developer of Particle, I am one of your big fan so i just wanted to take a moment to thank you for creating such an incredible AI app that has transformed the way I read and process articles and news.This AI has been an invaluable tool in my daily routine, making me more efficient and enhancing my understanding of various topics. I am now studying pharmacology at univ in Korea and nearly read nothing all day for, I‚Äôve been quite busy with exams:( one day, I saw a reels introducing your app so I gave a try which turned out to be awesome!!  Best feature I particularly appreciate is the related articles and following bottons, which allows me to get to know more about the content Im interested in and get instant, accurate summaries. This has saved me a tremendous amount of time, especially when dealing with complex or lengthy articles. Your app has not only made staying informed easier but has also made the process more enjoyable. I‚Äôm truly grateful for the hard work and innovation that went into developing such an app! üëç The user-friendly interface and the option to organize my library into collections make it feel like a personal assistant tailored just for me. I‚Äôve recommended AI to several friends and they‚Äôve all been impressed by its capabilities. The question popped up my head that how does this app earn fortunes for the developers? This service is completely free and I don‚Äôt particularly see ads (for my type at least) i sincerely hope this app one day costs a heavy fee as gpt or perplexity ;( and I also want to know is there any stock related with your app that I could own cause I strongly believe this service will one day skyrocket and that would come very soon. Thank you again for your dedication to creating such a helpful tool. It‚Äôs clear that a lot of thought and effort went into making it as effective and user-friendly as possible. Best regards,-yong-"
